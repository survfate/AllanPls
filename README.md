A Poe.Trade-inspired style for the official Path of Exile Trade website (pathofexile.com/trade)

## Requirement

## Installation & Update

[**Click on this with Stylus installed**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/survfate/AllanPls/master/allanpls_style.user.css)

## What is this?

- A Poe.Trade-inspired style with a packed, simplify layout for the official Path of Exile Trade website (**pathofexile.com/trade**)
- Still retain the official look of the game

**Note**: This style will only try to bring the Poe.Trade feel into the official Trade website for PC usage only, I will not focus on making this an all-purpose redesign.
